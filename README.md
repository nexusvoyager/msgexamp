# msgexamp

FYI This was created as a thing as a school to demonstrate what data is usually associated with messages, some help was from github copiolet (mainly the ip grabbing and your data is not being stolen, you can check the code if you'd like!)


This program is meant for demonstration and educational purposes, no data will be sent to the developers of this test tool, its just a fun tool to play with! Have fun <3 and be sure to star the project on github

Also you are free to redistribute and copy the code without giving credit, but credits are appreciated
